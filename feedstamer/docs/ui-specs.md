# Feedstamer UI/UX Specifications

## Design Philosophy
Feedstamer's design prioritizes focus, clarity, and intentional consumption. The interface should help users reclaim attention rather than compete for it.

## Design Principles
1. **Minimalism**: Remove unnecessary elements, notifications, and distractions
2. **Clarity**: Present content clearly with proper hierarchy and spacing
3. **Calm**: Use a soothing color palette that doesn't overstimulate
4. **Control**: Provide users with explicit control over their experience
5. **Intention**: Design for purposeful content consumption, not endless scrolling

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: #3A7CA5 (Calm blue - trust, focus)
- **Secondary**: #F2F2F2 (Light gray - neutrality, space)
- **Accent**: #16425B (Deep blue - authority, stability)
- **Background**: #FFFFFF (White - clarity, simplicity)
- **Text**: #2D2D2D (Soft black - readability without harshness)
- **Success**: #4CAF50 (Green - positive reinforcement)
- **Warning**: #FF9800 (Orange - moderate alert)
- **Dark Mode** variants of the above

## Typography
- **Primary Font**: SF Pro (iOS), Roboto (Android), Inter (Web)
- **Headings**: Medium weight, slightly larger than standard
- **Body Text**: Regular weight, optimized for readability (16-18px)
- **Accent Text**: Medium or Semibold weight for emphasis
- **Line Height**: 1.5x for comfortable reading
